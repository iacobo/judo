# 柔道 (Judo) 🥋

>精力善用  
`seiryoku zen'yō`  
>*"Maximum efficiency, minimum effort."*

>自他共栄  
`jita kyōei`  
>*"Mutual welfare and benefit."*

>In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, whilst adjusting to and evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger ones. This is the theory of **柔よく剛を制す**  
`jū yoku gō o seisu`   
>*"Softness controls hardness."*
